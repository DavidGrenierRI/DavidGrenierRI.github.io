		<h1>Real Jobs RI Report</h1>
		<h2>Prototypes</h2>
		<p>The Real Jobs Report prototypes have been updated with the last round of feedback. </p>

		<p>We've adjusted the Performance section as requested. Please review to confirm we understood the requests properly. The three large blocks for Placement Rate, Average Wage after Placement and Average Wage Gain represent a greater information weight than the other indicators. They may not be laid out as three large blocks but they should be styled to be much more prominent and imediately draw the viewers eye. </p>

		<p>We've added a color change on hover for the clickable tiles. This will indicate to the designer that there should be something that happens there to make it clear to a user that a tile is clickable. </p>

		<p>We've mocked up views for the Sector Partnerships and Employers Served details. We used the table of data on sector partnerships from the current RJRI site for content. We made up dummy content for the Employers Served view. There are four options for how detail views are displayed:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href='version_a/index.html' target=_blank>Version A</a> - The user clicks on a tile and is taken to a detail page for that indicator.</li>
			<li><a href='version_b/index.html' target=_blank>Version B</a> - The detail view is presented in a lightbox.</li>
			<li><a href='version_c/index.html' target=_blank>Version C</a> - A summary view is presented in a lightbox, with the option to click through to a details page.</li>
			<li><a href='version_d/index.html' target=_blank>Version D</a> - The detail view is presented on a separate page, but the indiator definition is included in the links title attribute so it will display on hover in most (non touchscreen) browsers.</li>
		</ul>


		<p>Of these four options I would recommend Version A.</p>
